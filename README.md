# node-mongoose-graphql-starter
Starter with graphql-compose and graphql-mongoose-compose

While learning graphql and trying to create a sample project connecting graphql with mongoDB and mongoose. I found an amazing article:- https://getstream.io/blog/tutorial-create-a-graphql-api-with-node-mongoose-and-express/
I realised I will use this setup in future for learning as well as to create my dumb projects which I often delete later.
This repo contains the code for the same.
